# Species-based Datasets

Species specific datasets are generated from the protein-protein interaction data curated from peer reviewed journals and are available here.

The data are based on the taxonomy of the proteins taking part in the interaction. Analysis of one such dataset, which involved Arabidopsis proteins has been discussed in PMID: [20371643](http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/22/4/997).
