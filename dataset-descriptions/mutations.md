# Mutations



There are several types of mutations covered, the terms used have been described in the PSI-MI controlled vocabularies, accessible at [www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi):

* Mutation \(MI:0118\): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event. _This root term is used when there is a mutation present in a protein and the wild type version has not been tested or shown to interact in the referenced paper._
  * Mutation causing an interaction \(MI:2227\): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event that enables an interaction when compared with the wild-type, which does not interact.
  * Mutation decreasing interaction \(MI:0119\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction strength or rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation decreasing interaction rate \(MI:1130\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation decreasing interaction strength \(MI:1133\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion decreases significantly interaction strength.
    * Mutation disrupting interaction \(MI:0573\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction strength or rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\). • Mutation disrupting interaction rate \(MI:1129\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\). • Mutation disrupting interaction strength \(MI:1128\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion totally disrupts an interaction strength. 
  * Mutation increasing interaction \(MI:0382\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction strength or rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation increasing interaction rate \(MI:1131\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction rate \(in the case of interactions inferred from enzymatic reaction\).
    * Mutation increasing interaction strength \(MI:1132\): Region of a molecule whose mutation or deletion increases significantly interaction strength.
  * Mutation with no effect \(MI:2226\): A change in a sequence or structure in comparison to a reference entity due to a insertion, deletion or substitution event that does not have any effect over an interaction when compared with the wild-type.
