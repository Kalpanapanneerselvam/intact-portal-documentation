# Data Export

## How are binary interactions selected for export to UniProtKB/GOA records?

All binary interactions evidences in the IntAct database, including those generated by Spoke expansion of co-complex data, are clustered to produce a non- redundant set of protein pairs. Each binary pair is then scored, using a simple addition of the cumulated value of a weighted score for the interaction detection method and the interaction type for each interaction evidence associated with that binary pair. Only experimental data is scored, inferred interactions, for example, would not be scored, and any low confidence data, or data manually tagged by a curator for exclusion from the process, are also not scored. Isoforms and post-processed protein chains are regarded as individual proteins for scoring purposes. We will, in future, export negative information, particularly for isoforms when one isoform of a protein behaves differently from another.

Score weightings were determined using the PSI-MI CV \([available here](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=MI)\) hierarchy i.e

| Interaction Detection Method | Weighting |
| :--- | :--- |
| Biochemical | 3 |
| Biophysical | 3 |
| Protein complementation Assay \(PCA\) | 2 |
| Imaging Techniques | 0.6 |

| Interaction Type | Weighting |
| :--- | :--- |
| Association | 1 |
| Physical Association | 2 |
| Direct Association \(and child terms\) | 5 |
| Colocalization | 0.2 |
