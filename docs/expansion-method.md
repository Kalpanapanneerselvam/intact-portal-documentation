# Expansion Method

### Binary interactions generated by co-complex expansion

#### Why should you care about complex expansion ?

Some experimental methods such as Tandem Affinity Purification do generate molecular interactions that can involve more than 2 molecules. Despite the fact that IntAct curation team do capture the molecular interaction as they were reported in the corresponding experiment, when you search using the intact web site, the results of your query is always shown as set of binary interactions \(i.e. 2 molecules\). We would like to draw your attention on the fact that whenever the reported interaction was a co-complex we do apply an expansion algorithm that transform this n-ary interaction into a set of binary interactions. While none of these agorithms is perfect and will very likely generate some false positive interactions, it is useful to present the data in a consistent manner. Bear in mind that we will strive to differentiate in the search results which interactions are a real experimental binary from expanded ones.

### Existing expansion algorithm

There are several known algorithms allowing to transform an n-ary interaction into a set of binaries. The illustration below present the two well known expansion model and illustrates why they can be incorrect.

* **Spoke expansion**: Links the bait molecule to all prey molecules. If N is the count of molecule in the complex, it generated N-1 binary interactions.
* **Matrix expansion**: Links all molecule to all other molecule present in the complex. If N is the count of molecule in the complex, it generated \(N\*\(N-1\)\)/2 binary interactions.

Now the issue \(as illustrated at the bottom right of the diagram above\) with these two models lies in the fact that the real complex might not be articulated around the experimental bait but instead, this bait might be linked to a smaller complex, hence most binary interaction generated by spoke and matrix expansion result in false positive.
