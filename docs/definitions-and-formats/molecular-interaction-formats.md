The PSI-MI TAB data interchange format is a common tab-delimited molecular interactions format. IntAct currently supports PSI-MITAB 2.5 and PSI-MITAB 2.7, documentation is available at [https://psicquic.github.io/PSIMITAB.html](https://psicquic.github.io/PSIMITAB.html).

### XML

The PSI-MI XML \(miXML\) data interchange format is an XML-based molecular interactions format. The version currently used by IntAct when returning results in XML are the PSI-MI XML 2.5 and 3.0 versions. Documentation is available at [https://psicquic.github.io/PSIMIXML.html](https://psicquic.github.io/PSIMIXML.html).

RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF formats supported in IntAct are RDF/XML and RDF/XML-ABBREV \(RDF Syntax Recommendation\), N3 \(Tim Berners-Lee's Notation 3 Language\), N-Triples \(RDF Core's N-Triples Language\) and Turtle \(Terse RDF Triple Language\).
